# Thesis Proposal

Tomography reconstruction plays a crucial role in analyzing the properties of fusionistic plasma. This technique involves mathematically inverting the measured data, specifically the brilliance captured by the soft x-ray cameras in RFX-mod, to obtain a spatial distribution of the plasma properties. In the context of this study, the focus is on obtaining the electron temperature. 

One of the challenges with current tomographic reconstruction of the plasma is its time-intensive nature, requiring significant computational resources. In this context, the development and application of a machine learning model could help expedite the tomographic reconstruction process, enabling real-time reconstruction of the plasma.

The aim of this work is to gain confidence in the actual tomographic reconstruction methods at Consorzio RFX, analyze the acquired data from previous experimental campaigns to curate a database usable for machine learning, and apply a machine learning procedure to obtain the coefficients of the Cormack-Bessel expansion, used to mathematically  obtain the 2D map of the emissivity.
